- Are the Italians the Best in MotoGP Championship? 

    In this notebook we are going to try to answer this question and see whether Italy is the best nation when it comes to performance in MotoGP.

    We are going to determine nation performance based on how many championships they have won, both in the constructor championships and in the actual rider championships

    The structure of the notebook:
        
        - 1. Constructors:
            - 1.1 Number of constructor championships won by each country.
            - 1.2 How the number of wins by each country distribute over the various categories?
            - 1.3 How the categories distribute over the wins of each country?
            - 1.4 How does nation performance change over the various decades? Has the change from 2-stroke to 4-stroke engines influenced it?
            - 1.5 Conclusions on constructor data.
        
        - 2. Drivers:
            - 2.1 Number of drivers per country.
            - 2.2 Number of world championships per country.
