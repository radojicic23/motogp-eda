                From this chart we can see how Italian manufacturers are the most winning ones in the 125cc, 350cc, 80cc and MotoE 
                Japanese manufacturers are the most successful in the 250cc and MotoGP categories. In the MotoGP class in particular Japanese manufacturers seem to be particularly dominant (having won just over 65% of all championships).
                Another interesting fact is how German constructors are extremely successful in the Moto2 category (83% of total editions won by them), but not really relevant in other classes.

                Most of wins by Italy come from 125cc, which helps to consolidate the previous intuition that Italian manufacturers were very successful in this category. MotoGP is the second category with the most wins. It's interesting to see that most of wins by Italy come from the 125cc, 250cc, 350cc categories (~ 70%), which suggests that they were more successful during the 2-stroke era than the 4-stroke era. Although Italian constructors have won more in 2-stroke categories than 4-stroke ones, they have won all editions of MotoE. The future of Electric Motosport racing looks very good for Italians.
                When it comes to Japan, most of their wins come from the MotoGP category, with 250cc being second. This again confirms the previous intuition that Japanese manufacturers have dominated this category.
                Wins by Germany are concentrated in the 50cc and Moto2 category.

                When considering total number of wins, Japanese manufacturers have won more than any other. When analyzing closer we can see that Japanese manufacturers wins concentrate in the MotoGP, followed by the 125cc and the 250cc. This could suggest that Japanese manufacturers are particularly good at producing large-sized 4-stroke engines and small-medium sized 2-stroke engines.
                When looking at Italian manufacturers wins we see that in the 125cc, closely followed by the MotoGP and 250cc categories (with very similar values). The most interesting fact here is that Italian manufacturers have won all editions of the MotoE.
                When looking at these numbers we can say that Japan is the most successful nation when in comes to manufacturing racing motorcycles.

      <h2>FINAL REPORT</h2>
      <div class="report">
        <p>
          Based on the data analyzed in this notebook, we saw that Italy is the 2nd best manufacutrer of morotcycles and the country with the best drivers.
          While Japan is the best when it comes to the constructor championships, it's in 8th place when it comes to championships won by its drivers. On the flip side, Spain is the 2nd country when it comes to drivers championship wins but does not have any significant constructor championship wins.
          Since Italy is the only nation that has very good number when it comes to both constructor and drivers championships, it's reasonable to say that overall Italy is the best nation in MotoGP.
